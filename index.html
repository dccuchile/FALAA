<h3 id="components-description">Components Description</h3>
<p><code>Retroformer</code> originally proposes three fundamental
components: an <em>Actor</em>, a <em>Retrospective model</em>, and a
memory module (short-term and long-term memory, as well as a <em>replay
buffer</em>). Along with these components, a reward model is trained and
used. Each component is presented below, providing the original
definition and its respective standardized adaptation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Actor</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Definition</strong>: The <strong>Actor</strong> is
described, like in <code>Reflexion</code>, as the component responsible
for solving the assigned task, using an LLM to generate and execute
actions in an environment.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation in <code>FALAA</code></strong>:
<ul>
<li>Defined as an additional component, consisting of two main
subcomponents: the <code>Planner</code>, which is responsible for
planning actions, and the <code>Executor</code>, which executes
them.</li>
<li>The original concept of “solving the task” is maintained but adapted
to fit within the <code>FALAA</code> structure for better integration
and compatibility with other agents.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Retrospective Model</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Definition</strong>: It consists of a smaller LLM
compared to the <em>Actor</em> and is responsible for producing
reflections (<em>feedback</em>) when the <em>Actor</em> fails in the
task.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation in <code>FALAA</code></strong>:
<ul>
<li>Associated with the <code>Reflector</code> component, whose function
is to generate reflections and insights on failures or possible
improvements in the <code>Actor</code>’s strategy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reward Model</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Definition</strong>: Specifically trained by
<code>Retroformer</code> to evaluate the quality of reflections
generated by the <em>Retrospective model</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation in <code>FALAA</code></strong>:
<ul>
<li>Designated as an independent object within the architecture, similar
to LLMs, dedicated to evaluation and reward assignment.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Memory Module</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Definition</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term memory</strong>: Stores the trajectory (actions,
observations, rewards) generated by the <em>Actor</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term memory</strong>: Saves reflections produced by the
<em>Retrospective model</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Replay buffer</strong>: Specialized memory for storing
triplets of prompts, reflections, and the accumulated reward of the
episode.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Adaptation in <code>FALAA</code></strong>:
<ul>
<li><code>Short-term memory</code>: Under the standard structure, it
stores a series of attributes, including the trajectory generated by the
<code>Actor</code> and the accumulated rewards of that trajectory, as
well as attributes aimed at the training process of
<code>Retroformer</code>.</li>
<li><code>Long-term memory for reflections</code>: Reflections are
stored in the <code>semantic memory</code> due to its nature of storing
knowledge.</li>
<li><code>Replay buffer</code>: Established as a dictionary that stores
a triplet of prompts, reflections, and their classification as correct
or incorrect for various environments. Stored in the
<code>episodic memory</code> due to its nature of storing past
experiences.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><code>Retroformer</code> utilizes all structures proposed by
<code>FALAA</code>, with the <code>procedural memory</code> playing a
key role due to the architecture’s training processes. This memory in
the <code>Retroformer</code> architecture can execute <em>learning
actions</em> through methods that implicitly update stored information,
modifying the LLM and neural network-based reward model policies.</p>
<p>The training process also influences the
<code>short-term memory</code>, which stores various information such as
<em>train_data</em>. The trajectory stored in the
<code>short-term memory</code> also undergoes modifications, adopting a
sequence that now includes the elements <code>Action</code>,
<code>Observation</code>, and <code>Reward</code>, reflecting the new
architectural needs for a more structured and efficient process.</p>
<hr />
<p>We define several Objects representing prompts and examples used in
the creation of actions and reflections by <code>Planner</code> and
<code>Reflector</code>, respectively. This is to make their composition
explicit, as in implementations they are often text strings or token
lists.</p>
<p>The <code>Evaluator</code> component plays a crucial role within the
architecture. Since it is responsible for generating evaluations and
thus rewards, it integrates the reward model dedicated to evaluating the
quality of reflections. <code>Evaluator</code> offers various functional
methods, including: - The evaluation of an action-observation pair
through a reward function. - Calculating the sum of rewards in a given
trajectory. - Determining whether an action corresponds to a final
response. - Assessing the quality of a reflection.</p>

</figure>
<p>In general, the architecture of <code>Retroformer</code> partially
retains the structure of <code>Reflexion</code>, but introduces
modifications and new functionalities, such as the use of rewards for
each step of the trajectory or new attributes in the
<code>short-term memory</code> used in the training processes of the
reward model and retrospective model.</p>
<p><strong>Behavior Description:</strong><br />
Figure 1 shows the main UML sequence diagram of a
<code>Retroformer</code> agent. Before interacting with the user,
<code>Retroformer</code> exists in a certain environment, so its
memories must be initialized (this fragment is identical to
<code>Reflexion</code> in Figure 2). Once initialized, an infinite loop
begins where the agent receives a new task from the user, which is added
to the <code>short-term memory</code> before proceeding with the work
cycle (condensed under the <em>ref</em> fragment referencing Figure 3).
After completing this process, the generated response is retrieved from
the <code>short-term memory</code> and returned to the user. Similar to
<code>Reflexion</code>, it is not explicitly described what should
happen if the response is not found, so we assume that the agent does
not perform any additional actions. Finally, the
<code>short-term memory</code> is cleared using its <code>Reset()</code>
method, leaving the agent ready to receive a new task.</p>

<h3 id="work-cycle-of-the-retroformer-agent">Work Cycle of the
Retroformer Agent</h3>
<figure>

alt="UML sequence diagram of the work cycle of a Retroformer agent." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">UML sequence diagram of the work cycle of
a <code>Retroformer</code> agent.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Regarding the referenced work cycle (see Figure 2), it is observed
that the <code>Retroformer</code> agent maintains a work cycle similar
to that of <code>Reflexion</code>, consisting of a loop running from 1
to the maximum value <em>episode_limit</em>, which indicates the number
of failed responses allowed before ending the cycle. The loop continues
as long as the response generated in the previous iteration is not
correct. In each iteration, the <code>Actor</code> attempts to solve the
task (see Figure 3), returning the sum of the accumulated rewards in its
trajectory along with an indication of whether the task was successfully
resolved. If the task is not successfully resolved, the process of
generating reflections is executed, introducing a new flow (see Figure
4). Finally, a new iteration begins.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="task-resolution-process-of-the-actor-component">Task Resolution
Process of the Actor Component</h3>
<p>The task resolution process of the <code>Actor</code>, as shown in
Figure 3, remains as general as possible, since <code>Retroformer</code>
allows replacing the <code>Actor</code> with components from other
agents. The task resolution flow is based on two parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Part One</strong>: A loop with a maximum of
<em>step_limit</em> steps, where in each step, <code>Planner</code> is
asked to generate an action (the planning and corresponding information
retrieval process for prompt creation is the same as in
<code>Reflexion</code>, see Figures 5 and 6, respectively). The
generated action is then evaluated to determine if it is the final
response, which would end the loop. If not, <code>Executor</code>
executes the action, receiving an observation that is added to the
trajectory in the <code>short-term memory</code> (the process is the
same as in <code>Reflexion</code>, see Figure 7). Then, the
action-observation pair is evaluated using the reward function of
<code>Evaluator</code>, returning a score for this step, which is
converted into a <em>Reward</em> object and added to the
<code>short-term memory</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part Two</strong>: Occurs when the loop ends, either by
reaching the step limit or by finding the correct response. The current
episode is then evaluated, where the accumulated rewards from the
current trajectory are obtained, and it is determined whether the
response is correct or not, returning these two values.</p></li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p>The process of selecting the best reflection from the
<code>Reflector</code> component of a <code>Retroformer</code> agent,
shown in Figure 1, is the main innovation of this architecture. It
illustrates how <code>Reflector</code> generates
<code>reflection_tries</code> reflections in a loop. In each step of
this loop: 1. A reflection is generated using the <code>reflect()</code>
method (see Figure 2). 2. A prompt composed of information from
short-term and long-term memories (see Figure 3) is used to generate a
reflection, which is then returned.</p>
<p>Once the reflection is generated, it is evaluated using the
<code>Evaluator</code> component, which acts as an intermediary. Using
the prompt and the generated reflection, <code>Evaluator</code> applies
its pre-trained neural network model to assess the quality of the
reflection. If the reflection is better than the best one stored so far,
it is saved as the best reflection in the
<code>short-term memory</code>. At the end of the cycle, the best
reflection is stored in the <code>semantic memory</code>, ensuring that
the storage limit is not exceeded.</p>

with the current task and trajectory retrieved from the

prompt, before being returned, is stored in the

reflections, along with the supervised learning-based training of the

of the three RLHF steps: 1. <strong>Data Collection</strong>: Figure 4
illustrates this step. 2. <strong>Training a Reward Model</strong>:
Figure 5 illustrates this step. 3. <strong>Fine-Tuning the
Reflector</strong>: Figure 6 illustrates this step.</p>
